## Apple Music Downloader

## How to use:
run main.py

To download a playlist, enter one link to the playlist or several separated by commas

Note:
Not all songs can be downloaded, because some may not be on YouTube, where the download is from. 
If some song didn't load or loaded incorrectly, try downloading it separately by simply adding a link to it.
